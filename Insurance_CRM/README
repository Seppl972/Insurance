# Insurance Management System – Java Project (GUI)

Welcome to my first coding project for solving real world problems! This Java-based application is designed to simulate basic processes within an insurance company. It serves as a practical application of object-oriented programming and software engineering concepts I have learned during my studies.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Demonstrate object-oriented design principles in a real-life context  
- Apply Java.swing fundamentals 
- Learning to implement a SQL database to a software

## 🛠️ Features

- Manage customer profiles (add, update, delete)
- Basic java.swing GUI interface
- Connected to SQL-Database

## 📚 Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- VSCode (for development)
- Git for version control

## 💡 Learned Concepts in Practice

- Object-oriented programming (OOP):
- Simple GUI with Java.swing
   > in progress
   > Currently developing user interfaces using Java Swing components (e.g., JFrame, JButton, JTextField) to enhance interactivity.
- SQL-Database for data  
   > in progress
   > Working on connecting Java applications to an SQL database using JDBC to perform CRUD operations and manage persistent data.

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seppl972/Insurance_CRM.git
   cd Insurance_CRM-java
