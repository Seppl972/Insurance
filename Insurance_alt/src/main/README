# Insurance Management System – Java Project

Welcome to my first coding project! This Java-based application is designed to simulate basic processes within an insurance company. It serves as a practical application of object-oriented programming and software engineering concepts I have learned during my studies.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Apply Java fundamentals in a real-life context  
- Demonstrate object-oriented design principles  
- Simulate typical insurance operations like customer management, policy creation, and claims processing  
- Create a maintainable and extendable codebase

## 🛠️ Features

- Manage customer profiles (add, update, delete)
	=> the three methods have been implemented succesfully
- Create and manage insurance policies
- Simulate the filing and processing of claims
- Basic console-based interface

## 📚 Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (for development)
- Git for version control

## 💡 Learned Concepts in Practice

- Object-oriented programming (OOP): Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism  
- Collections (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap) for data handling  
- Exception handling and validation  
- Basic software architecture and modularization  
- Input/output operations  
- Simple CLI (command-line interface)

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-management-java.git
   cd insurance-management-java
