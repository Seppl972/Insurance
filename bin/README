# Insurance Management System – Java Project (GUI)

Welcome to my first coding project for solving real world problems! This Java-based application is designed to simulate basic processes within an insurance company. It serves as a practical application of object-oriented programming and software engineering concepts I have learned during my studies.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Apply Java.swing fundamentals in a real-life context  
- Demonstrate object-oriented design principles  
- Simulate typical CRM operations
- Create a maintainable and extendable application

## 🛠️ Features

- Manage customer profiles (add, update, delete)
- Create and manage insurance policies
- Simulate the filing and processing of claims
- Basic java.swing GUI interface


## 📚 Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- VSCode (for development)
- Git for version control

## 💡 Learned Concepts in Practice

- Object-oriented programming (OOP):
- SQL for data handling  
   > in progress
- Simple GUI (Java.swing interface)
   > in progress

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seppl972/Insurance_CRM.git
   cd Insurance_CRM-java
